# Nightly Build — 2026-02-14

**Time:** 08:00 UTC  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Built:** System Reliability Dashboard

---

## Friction Identified

From today's reflection and beads tasks:
- 6 cron jobs failing with Discord recipient format errors
- No visibility into which jobs are healthy vs. failing
- Technical debt accumulating (hydroxide issues, uncommitted files)

**The core problem:** No easy way to see system reliability at a glance.

---

## What Was Built

**Tool:** `tools/reliability-dashboard.js`

A Node.js script that provides system-wide health monitoring:

### Features
- **Reliability Score:** Calculates % of healthy jobs
- **Job Health Summary:** Total, healthy, warning, critical, disabled counts
- **Priority-Based Analysis:** Critical, high, medium priority job tracking
- **Hydroxide Health:** Email system status
- **Disk Usage:** Per-filesystem utilization with status indicators
- **Top Errors:** Recent error patterns
- **JSON Mode:** `--json` flag for programmatic use
- **Historical Reports:** Saves daily snapshots to `memory/reliability-reports/`

### Usage
```bash
# Interactive dashboard
node tools/reliability-dashboard.js

# JSON output for automation
node tools/reliability-dashboard.js --json
```

### Output Example
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          SYSTEM RELIABILITY DASHBOARD                  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🔴 Reliability Score: 0%

📊 Job Health Summary:
   Total Jobs: 16
   ✅ Healthy: 10
   ⚠️  Warning: 2
   🔴 Critical: 4
   ⏸️  Disabled: 0

📧 Email (Hydroxide):
   ✅ Running (2 processes)

💾 Disk Usage:
   ✅ /data: 9% used
```

## Limitations

- Cron job fetching requires gateway API access (currently uses fallback)
- Reliability score calculation needs full job list
- Future: Integrate with cron API for real-time job status

---

## Why This Matters

**The trench warfare insight:** Small failures compound. Without visibility, we don't notice gradual degradation until it's critical.

This dashboard makes reliability **visible** and **measurable** — the first step toward making it a priority.
