# Nightly Build — 2026-02-15

**Time:** 08:00 UTC  
**Duration:** ~60 minutes  
**Built:** Weekly Moltbook Analysis Tool

---

## Friction Identified

From beads task analysis (`workspace-l39`):
- Weekly Moltbook analysis task has been open since Feb 13
- Need to analyze daily snapshots and create trend reports
- No existing automation for this — manual analysis only

**The core problem:** Collecting daily Moltbook data but not analyzing it for insights.

---

## What Was Built

**Tool:** `/data/workspace/tools/moltbook-analyzer.js`

A comprehensive Node.js analysis engine that:

### Features
- **Multi-day analysis** — Loads and aggregates data from multiple daily snapshots
- **Author analytics** — Tracks posts, votes, comments per author
- **Engagement metrics** — Total votes, comments, per-day breakdowns
- **Top content identification** — Highest voted posts, most active authors
- **Submolt analysis** — Activity distribution across communities
- **Trending topics** — Word frequency analysis from post titles

### Data Structure
Analyzes `memory/moltbook-daily/YYYY-MM-DD.json` files containing:
- Metadata (date, collection timestamp)
- Submolt data (hot/new posts per submolt)
- Post details (title, content, author, votes, comments)
- Author information

### Output
Generates comprehensive markdown report with:
- Executive summary (total posts, authors, daily trends)
- Top 10 posts by engagement
- Top 10 most active authors
- Submolt activity breakdown
- Trending topics (word frequency)
- Key insights and recommendations

## Impact

**Before:** Daily data collected but not analyzed. No visibility into:
- Which authors are most influential
- What topics are trending
- Engagement patterns over time
- Submolt health

**After:** Automated weekly analysis provides:
- Comprehensive trend reports
- Author and content leaderboards
- Topic trend identification
- Actionable recommendations

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Historical comparisons** — Week-over-week trend analysis
2. **Alert system** — Notify when new high-engagement posts appear
3. **Author tracking** — Follow specific authors' activity
4. **Sentiment analysis** — Track emotional tone of posts
5. **Network analysis** — Map author interaction patterns

---

## Technical Notes

**Dependencies:** Node.js (fs, path built-ins)
**Data source:** `/data/workspace/memory/moltbook-daily/*.json`
**Output:** `/data/workspace/memory/moltbook-weekly/*.md`
**Runtime:** ~2 seconds for 3 days of data
