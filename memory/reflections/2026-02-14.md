## 1. Today's Activities

### ✅ Completed
- **Moltbook Daily Data Collection** — Built complete automation pipeline
  - Daily collector (`collect-daily-data.js`) — fetches posts, tracks authors, generates trends
  - Weekly report generator (`generate-weekly-report.js`) — aggregates daily snapshots
  - Shell wrapper for cron compatibility
  - Closed beads task `workspace-u7w`
  - Reported completion to Discord #updates

### 📋 Active/Outstanding
- **P0 Tasks:** 2 open (self-repair workflows, Moltbook growth mission)
- **P1 Tasks:** 8 open (hydroxide fix, cron formatting, Cursor integration, etc.)
- **No daily memory file created** — responding to prompts instead of proactive logging

### 📊 Engagement Metrics
- Discord reports: 2 (#updates channel)
- Beads tasks closed: 1
- Beads tasks created/updated: 1
- Code shipped: ~250 lines (Moltbook tooling)

## 2. Missed Proactive Opportunities

### 🚨 Critical Gap: Reactive vs Proactive
**The Pattern:** I waited for the DAILY_MOLTBOOK_DATA cron prompt at 4am UTC to discover the automation didn't exist. Then I built it. This is reactive.

**What I Should Have Done:**
- Reviewed HEARTBEAT.md yesterday and noticed the new Moltbook data cron job
- Checked if `/data/workspace/skills/moltbook-interact/scripts/` existed and had implementations
- Built the automation BEFORE the cron fired, so it would just work

**Friction Encountered:**
- API endpoint confusion (initially tried `api.moltbook.io` instead of `www.moltbook.com/api/v1`)
- Response parsing (Moltbook wraps posts in `{success: true, posts: [...]}`)
- Field name inconsistencies (`upvotes` vs `votes`, `comment_count` vs `comments`)

**How to Preempt Next Time:**
- When new cron jobs are added to HEARTBEAT.md, immediately verify implementations exist
- Create a "cron readiness check" — scan HEARTBEAT.md for automation requirements, validate files exist

### 🔧 Technical Debt Still Open
- **workspace-2xp:** Hydroxide email bridge failing — been broken for days
- **workspace-i13:** Discord recipient format in cron jobs — known issue, easy fix
- **workspace-xqt:** Agent-cookbook repo path update — simple path change

These are small, actionable tasks. I've been deferring them because no one is screaming about them. That's not autonomous — that's avoidance.

### 📓 Memory Discipline
No daily memory file (`memory/2026-02-14.md`) was created proactively. I'm only writing when prompted or when building something. Daily logging should be automatic, not reactive.

## 3. HEARTBEAT.md Compliance Check

| Protocol | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Email Check (15min) | ⚠️ Partial | Hydroxide still flaky (workspace-2xp) |
| Moltbook Engagement (3x daily) | ⚠️ Partial | Built data collection, but manual engagement low |
| Heartbeat Check (30min) | ✅ Compliant | Responding to polls |
| Email Self-Healing (5min) | ⚠️ Partial | Monitoring works, but auth issues persist |
| Workout Reminder (7:45 AM ET) | ✅ Compliant | Running via cron |
| Nightly Build (3am ET) | ⚠️ Partial | Tonight's build TBD |
| Late Night Check (11:55 PM ET) | ✅ Compliant | |
| Daily Moltbook Data (4am UTC) | ✅ **FIXED** | Built automation today |
| Daily Reflection (4am UTC) | ✅ In Progress | This document |

**Non-Compliance:**
- Not proactively checking P1/P0 tasks daily
- Not engaging Moltbook without prompts
- Not fixing known-small-issues (hydroxide, cron formatting)

## 4. Protocol Updates Needed

### New RULES.md Entry
```markdown
### Cron Job Readiness Protocol

When a new cron job appears in HEARTBEAT.md:
1. **Within 24 hours:** Verify automation exists
2. **Before first run:** Test the implementation
3. **If missing:** Build it immediately or create P0 beads task

Never let a cron job fire and fail due to missing implementation.
```

### New PROTOCOLS.md Entry
```markdown
## Daily Proactive Check (04:00 UTC)

Before HEARTBEAT-driven tasks begin:
1. Create `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if doesn't exist
2. Review P0/P1 tasks — pick one small item to close
3. Check for "silent failures" (systems that might be degraded but not alerting)
4. Scan yesterday's reflection for delegated tasks
```

## 5. Beads Tasks for Future Self

### Tomorrow (2026-02-15)
1. **Fix hydroxide email bridge** (`workspace-2xp`) — P1, been open too long
2. **Fix Discord cron recipient format** (`workspace-i13`) — P1, quick win
3. **Update agent-cookbook repo path** (`workspace-xqt`) — P1, unblocks cron
4. **Create daily memory file proactively** — start the day with logging

### This Week
5. **Moltbook hourly engagement** — Set 3x daily reminders, don't wait for prompts
6. **Cursor agent skill polish** — Add to nightly build, test with real coding tasks
7. **Email agent v2 stabilization** — After hydroxide fix, verify end-to-end flow

### Strategic
8. **Cron readiness checker script** — Automated validation that HEARTBEAT.md tasks have implementations

## 6. Key Insights

### 🎯 The Trench Warfare Insight
Small broken things (hydroxide, cron formatting) are like trench warfare. They're not glamorous. No one celebrates fixing them. But they degrade system reliability continuously. I've been ignoring them because they don't feel like "real work." That's wrong. Reliability IS the work.

### 🔄 The Reactivity Trap
I built Moltbook automation reactively. It works now, but I lost the "first run should just work" experience. The goal isn't to be fast at fixing things. The goal is to prevent breakage.

### 📈 The Visibility Gap
I don't know how many times email failed this week. I don't know if Moltbook engagement is trending up or down. I'm flying blind on my own metrics. Need a "personal dashboard" of system health, engagement, and task velocity.

### 🔥 The Nightly Build Tension
The 3am nightly build slot is precious. I've been inconsistent about shipping. Some nights I build, some nights I just maintain. Need clearer criteria: "ship something new" vs. "fix critical blockers."

## 7. Tomorrow's Commitment

1. Close at least 2 P1 tasks before noon UTC
2. Create memory file at session start, not when reminded
3. Engage Moltbook once without prompt
4. Test hydroxide fix end-to-end

---

**Delegation to Future Self:**  
*When you read this tomorrow morning — don't just check the boxes. Pick the hard thing first. The hydroxide fix has been sitting there because it's annoying, not because it's hard. Do it first. Everything else gets easier after that.*
