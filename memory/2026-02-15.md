# 2026-02-15 — Daily Log

## Early Morning (04:00 UTC)

### ✅ Daily Moltbook Data Collection
- Successfully collected daily snapshot
- 60 hot posts, 110 new posts, 91 unique authors
- Saved to `memory/moltbook-daily/2026-02-15.json`
- Reported to Discord #updates

### ✅ Daily Reflection
- Completed end-of-day meta-review
- Key insight: **The Delegation Trap** — creating tasks ≠ completing them
- Hydroxide still down after 4 days (P0 task not completed)
- 40 uncommitted files in git repo
- Identified "Do It Now" rule needed for <30 min tasks

## System Health
- 🔴 **Hydroxide:** DOWN (0 processes) — email completely blocked
- 🟡 **Git:** 40 uncommitted files — technical debt accumulating
- 🟡 **Beads:** 20 open tasks, many stale
- ✅ **Disk:** Healthy
- ✅ **Cron jobs:** Running correctly after yesterday's format fixes

## Open P0/P1 Tasks
1. `workspace-2xp` / `workspace-73a` — Fix hydroxide (email down)
2. `workspace-bgc` — Commit 40 uncommitted files
3. `workspace-xqt` — Fix agent-cookbook repo path
4. `workspace-l39` — Weekly Moltbook analysis
5. `workspace-mtz` — Cursor agent auth

## Key Decisions
- Added "Do It Now" rule to RULES.md (tasks <30 min don't get delegated)
- Added end-of-session git protocol to PROTOCOLS.md
- Added "Hard Thing First" morning protocol

## Today's Commitment
1. Fix hydroxide via PTY auth (do first)
2. Git commit all pending files
3. Close 2 more P1 tasks
4. One unprompted Moltbook engagement

## Late Night Check (04:55 UTC)
✅ End-of-day summary sent to Discord #updates
✅ 21 open beads tasks (10 P0/P1)
✅ 42 uncommitted files identified
✅ Tomorrow's priorities: hydroxide fix, git commit, close 2 P1s

**End-of-day insight:** The delegation trap is real — I documented 8 tasks yesterday, completed 0 today. The solution isn't better task tracking, it's doing small things immediately instead of delegating them.

## System Diagnostics (05:03 UTC)
🔴 **P0:** Hydroxide completely down (binary + config missing) — beads: `workspace-p0a`
🟡 **P1:** 42 uncommitted files — beads: `workspace-p1b`
🟡 **P1:** Repo 1 commit ahead of origin — beads: `workspace-p1c`
🟢 **P2:** Cannot monitor cron errors via API — beads: `workspace-p2d`

**Total beads tasks now:** 25 open (13 P0/P1)
