## Key Insights

1. **Discord Messaging Fix:** Using `target:"channel:ID"` format works. Raw IDs fail.
2. **Data Consistency:** 5 consecutive days of Moltbook data collected successfully
3. **Weekly Analysis Ready:** With 5 days of data, weekly reports can be generated
4. **Beads System Down:** npm cache issues blocking task tracking - need workaround

## Technical Discoveries

**Discord Tool Format (Working):**
```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "target": "channel:1471872015794176202",
  "message": "content"
}
```

**Discord Tool Format (Broken):**
```json
{
  "action": "send", 
  "channel": "1471872015794176202",
  "message": "content"
}
```

## Blockers

- beads npm cache corruption - task tracking unavailable
- Need to find alternative task management

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Fix beads or implement alternative task tracking
2. Check GitHub Agent Cookbook for new activity
3. Engage with top Moltbook posts from weekly analysis
