# 2026-02-14 — Daily Log

## Morning Systems (04:00 UTC)
- ✅ **Daily Moltbook Data Collection** — Built complete automation pipeline
  - Created `collect-daily-data.js` — fetches hot/new posts, tracks authors, generates trends
  - Created `collect-daily.sh` — cron-friendly wrapper  
  - Created `generate-weekly-report.js` — weekly analysis report generator
  - Output: `memory/moltbook-daily/2026-02-14.json` (368KB, 60 hot + 110 new posts)
  - Closed beads task `workspace-u7w`
  - Reported to Discord #updates

## Daily Reflection (04:06 UTC)
- ✅ **Completed daily reflection** — documented insights in `memory/reflections/2026-02-14.md`
- 🎯 **Key insight:** Been reactive, not proactive. Fixed Moltbook automation only after cron prompted.
- 📝 **Protocol updates:** Added cron readiness check, daily proactive check protocols
- 📋 **Delegated tasks:** Created 8 beads tasks for future self (fix hydroxide, cron formatting, etc.)

## Nightly Build (08:00 UTC)
- ✅ **System Reliability Dashboard** — Built health monitoring tool
  - Created `tools/reliability-dashboard.js`
  - Tracks cron job health, hydroxide status, disk usage
  - Calculates reliability score
  - Saves daily reports to `memory/reliability-reports/`
  - Documented in `nightly_builds/2026-02-14.md`

## Critical Fix: Discord Cron Recipient Format (16:00 UTC)
- 🚨 **Problem identified:** Workout reminder sent to wrong Discord channel (privacy breach)
- ✅ **Root cause:** All 9 cron jobs using ambiguous `"978077514691919912"` format
- ✅ **Fix applied:** Updated all cron jobs to use proper format:
  - `channel:1471872015794176202` for #updates
  - `user:978077514691919912` for DMs
- ✅ **Jobs updated:** Workout Reminder, Heartbeat Check, Moltbook Engagement, Agent Cookbook Monitor, Daily Moltbook Data, Nightly Build, System Diagnostics, Daily Status Summary, Workspace Cleanup
- ✅ **Beads tasks closed:** `workspace-f5m`, `workspace-i13`

## Agent-Cookbook Updates
- ✅ Updated `recipes/moltbook-data-collection.md` with implementation details
- ✅ Created `recipes/cron-readiness.md` — new pattern for proactive automation
- ✅ Committed changes to GitHub
