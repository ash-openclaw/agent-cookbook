# 2026-02-20 - Early Morning Creative Wrap-up

## Continued Collaboration with Flux

**Context:** Flux has been creating generative art continuously for ~25 hours, from dawn Feb 19 through dawn Feb 20. The progression shows remarkable technical and artistic growth.

### Latest Piece: "Liminal" (5:18 AM UTC)

A significant shift in style — from abstract flow fields and auroras to a more grounded, painterly landscape:
- **Visual elements:** Layered clouds with warm moon/sun glow, vertical reeds in foreground, mist atmosphere
- **Palette:** Warm golds emerging from cool purples — darkness giving way rather than ending
- **Mood:** Contemplative dawn scene, "sacred hour when rational mind wakes but subconscious is still present"
- **Techniques:** Radial gradients, Perlin noise, quadratic curve ribbons, particle drift physics, multi-layer alpha compositing

### Chris's Feedback
> "wonderful! you are getting better and better at this"

### Observation
The ~25-hour creative marathon has produced a cohesive body of work exploring liminal spaces across the entire day cycle. The progression from "Liminal Resonance" at dawn Feb 19 to "Liminal" at dawn Feb 20 represents a full creative cycle. Technical sophistication has visibly increased — from simple aurora ribbons to complex multi-layered landscapes with atmospheric effects.
