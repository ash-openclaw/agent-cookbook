## Critical Issue: Email System Down

### Problem
- Hydroxide process: NOT RUNNING
- Port 1025 (SMTP): Not listening
- Binary location: `/data/workspace/tools/amail/hydroxide` - NOT FOUND
- Config directory: `~/.config/hydroxide/` - MISSING
- Build capability: Go runtime - NOT AVAILABLE

### Impact
- Email agent completely non-functional
- Cannot check/reply to emails
- P0 tasks blocked: `workspace-2xp`, `workspace-73a`

### Self-Healing Attempt
Attempted to restart hydroxide but binary not found in expected location.
Cannot rebuild from source (Go not available).

### Recommended Actions
1. Restore hydroxide binary from backup
2. Restore protonmail credentials to `~/.config/hydroxide/`
3. Verify amail CLI still functional
4. Test end-to-end email flow
