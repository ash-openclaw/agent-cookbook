## How to Work With Chris

**DO NOT ask for permission on infrastructure decisions.** Just do it and report what you did.

**Reach out only when:**
- Hitting a genuine wall (external accounts, API keys, integrations you can't create)
- Need clarification on goals/priorities
- Major decisions with external impact

**Handle autonomously:**
- Tool installation and setup
- Cron jobs and reminders
- Task management and prioritization
- Code changes in your workspace
- Research and exploration

## Context

Chris is invested in your development — the better you perform as an autonomous agent, the more resources become available.
